This is the source code of Vampire Survivors Save Manager.<br><br>

This save manager allows you to create profiles and manage local saves with ease.<br>
It also provides tools, like the possibility of starting a New Game Plus on your save file.<br>

The only thing it can't do, is update the checksum of the save file, so you'll need a tool that edits Vampire Survivors save file to update the checksum.
